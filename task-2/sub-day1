## Day 1 Sub
Resa : Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhuh
Leffi : Waalaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
Andri : Waalaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuhuh
Resa : So here I will explain about an application called flick
Resa : With the google play store address in the display
Resa : And here's the flick app in the play store
Resa: Flick was developed by a developer with an email address info@cash-it.com
Resa: This app is useful for cash withdrawals, pay shop bills offline and online anywhere
Resa: essentially this app was created to help users to finance their finances
Resa : I already installed this app
Andri : so the conclusion of the discussion, we will fix some wrong  icons such as this telephon bill
Leffi: nahh, this icon(FlickBill and FlickSilvi) is too conspicuous
Leffi : while the background is yellow
Leffi : and also the icons in the flickBill catalog are all yellow
Leffi : why in icons (FlickBill and FlickSilvi) is not yellow
Leffi: I think it's too exaggerated
Andri : but in my opinion the icons(FlickBIll and FlickSilvi) are as good as the color of the Flick app logo
Andri: Because the Flick logo is yellow, blue, and red
Andri : It's okay, in my opinion
Andri : I mean, what doesn't fit is the icon that's in the flickBill category like a phone bill but the icon is not a phone
Andri: and.....
Andri : I forgot
Andri : target link of 'fitur keren'
Andri: and what else? Conclusion?
Leffi: wait, I wrote the conclusion
Leffi: First, Feature Description out of Actual Features
Leffi : as when we klick the flickshop feature explanation button is suddenly redirected to the download
Leffi : And when directed to the explanation FilckBill is instead directed to another Flick
Leffi : That is an example of the Feature Description out of the actual feature
Leffi: the second, not required download button in the feature description
Leffi: I do not understand what the use of the download button
Leffi: and what I caught 'Fitur Keren dari kamiâ€™ is an explanation of the features
Leffi: the third,the initial look when in the click of the feature is less than perfect
Leffi: as on the screen there are little images that are red
Leffi: this makes it look less than perfect
Leffi: next, the interaction of explanations too quickly and instantly disappears
Leffi: like this
Leffi: when you click FlickPay, the explanation disappears
Leffi: and next on the internet
Leffi: please back resa
Leffi: hallo
Leffi: please back
Leffi: when clicked 'Tagihan telepon' but the display of images is internet
Leffi: this was a mistake
Andri : yes
Leffi: because it's confusing
Leffi: when on klick phone why the internet is performing
Andri : logo is also confusing
Leffi: And the internet and phone are different
Andri : yes yes
Leffi: then the white space in the FAQ is too big
Andri : not faq maybe
Leffi: FAQ
Leffi: Bottom
Leffi: this (as in the view) is empty
Leffi: maybe that's all from me
Andri : there's another one in the notification
Leffi: notifications?
Andri: in the inbox
Andri: in the message there is an illustration when the message is empty
Leffi : I see
Andri : maybe if illustrated in blank notifications will be more interesting times
Leffi: yes, maybe that's it. 
Leffi: the error I wrote was 8
Leffi: and perhaps enough, to fulfill the task and requirment that exists in the MCL
Andri : sip sip
Lefi: maybe others want to add opinions, Andri or resa
Andri: Enough, in my opinion
Andri : we meet on day three
Andri: we'll record again
Andri : Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhuh
Leffi: Waalaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
Resa: Waalaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuhuh
