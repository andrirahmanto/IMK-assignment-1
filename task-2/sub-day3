## Day 3 Sub
Leffi: Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakaatuh
All : Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh
Leffi: on this third day, we want to let you know the design we've made
Leffi: the voter here is two people, namely muhammad ardani and zaidan pratama
Leffi: Thank you for taking your time
Zaidan,Ardani: you're welcome
Leffi: can start right away 
Andri: for the one on the left this is mine
Andri: and for the right has leffi
Andri: for the first one there is no difference in my design with leffi design
Andri: and the changes we make are in the 'phone bill' icon
Andri: which was previously a computer-shaped icon featuring internet images
Andri: in this section, the design I made and leffi the same
Andri: the second
Resa: there's one more difference
Resa : in design you can be sliding
Andri: oh yes
Andri: and the difference between our designs is in the "fitru cool" section
Andri: for my design, the look can be sliding
Andri: for leffi design, the look can not be slided
Andri: that's all for the difference
Andri: after that, on page 2
Andri: the page that was wrong resulted in the wrong page afterwards
Andri: when I click the icon "phone bill" displays an internet page with a computer logo
Andri: the design I created, I took the previous phone icon, and I fixed it. And I also changed the title of the page
Andri : this is my design, it's leffi design
Andri: okay?
Resa: understand
Andri: for the third design is on the page "FlickShop feature"
Andri: the initial view before it's fixed like this
Andri: when we click on the FlickShop feature, we point to the website outside the app. With the condition of the website minimized to the frame of the mobile phone
Andri: for the design improvements I made
Andri: I made the look of the website into a native page in the app
Andri: so it is possible not to link the website outside
Andri: I created a feature in the card that later the card can be on the slide
Andri: until.....
Resa: feature description completed
Andri: yes, until the feature description is complete
Andri: to leffi he still uses a link to the website flick.id 
Andri: but there are some changes, in the section of the download button and and the teaching button, which is changed in position
Andri: The feature description on the main page is three, namely, FlickShop, FlickBIll, FlickSilvi
Andri: in the design I created, I distinguish the next look in each of those fitur
Andri: in the change of design owned by leffi, leffi also changed in the insurance icon
Andri: whose previous icon was a computer
Andri: it's a change of design from leffi
Andri: I do not know what if here there is an error on the logo
Andri: like that alone, 5 pages from me and 5 pages from leffi
Andri: which option do you prefer? Design from me or from leffi?
Andri: starting with resa
Resa: for the design of the first page in my opinion, better design andri
Resa: because, for in the same icon design change
Resa: but for in "cool features of us",I choose onslide
Resa: because, if you want to add features in the future, it will be easy to add a card 
Resa: why don't I like leffi design?
Resa: because, in the design of leffi, when there is an addition of features it will be a downward addition
Resa: which I don't think is cool, cooler that can be sliding
Ardani: the difference here is only in our cool features right?
Resa: yes, in the icon and in can be slided or not
Ardani: same phone icon
Ardani: I prefer the sliding
Resa: okay
Ardani: look more responsive
Zaidan: my opinion is the same, preferring that can be sliding
Zaidan: because, if there is a later addition of the feature will not be a downward addition
Zaidan: so later the main page doesn't change much, and it's better
Andri: okay
Resa: we go to the next page
Resa: for this page also I prefer andri design, why?
Resa: first, the title is right, phone bill
Resa: the original page had an internet title, and was changed to a phone bill instead of a phone
Resa: for the icon, the outer and inside icons are the same in the design andri
Resa: so I prefer the design andri again
Ardani: the important thing here is the title of this page
Ardani: will be disingenrifying, if it is only written only the phone
Ardani: if there is a phone bill, it will make it clear that this is payment, not anything else like information and anything else
Zaidan: I prefer andri design, because, from the title of the page will be clearer for the users
Zaidan: and for the display of balance both have it
Zaidan: visually the left design is more interesting
Zaidan: from me that's it
Andri: next
Resa: this is for the look of our cool features right?
Resa: In my opinion, it would be better if the page was made native
Resa: so later, there will be a place, where the information in it can be changed according to what is clicked
Resa: and better at being native view compared to web view
Resa: although, the reason for being a web display is to increase those web visitors
Resa: but in this case, when all features are redirected to the same page, the user will assume it is an error on the click
Resa: and it will make the user feel confused by what he clicks
Resa: so, I'm more likely to agree that the look becomes separate and makes for a more attractive look
Resa: overall I prefer andri design
Resa: what does ardani think?
Ardani: I agree with resa
Ardani: what if when clicked, suddenly popup appears, it's like opening an ad, it's likely that the user will close it immediately
Ardani: so the user will not get the information on the page
Ardani: and I like the simple
Ardani: on this page, no need to open another, just slide it
Resa: yes it is
Ardani: that's it
Ardani: prefer andri design 
Zaidan: from me just like the others, andri won again
Zaidan: the reason I'm the same, I prefer simple and easy, that's all
Andri: so what's the conclusion of each?
Resa: so far the designs prefer andri design
Resa: which can be swiped, then a cool fitru page from us
Resa: andri and leffi design is good, but I prefer andri
Resa: next ardani
Ardani: for me, the main point I prefer is that it doesn't bring up the outside web, and stays inside the app, so as not to confuse users
Ardani: so I prefer andri
Andri: thejuta zaidan
Zaidan: I prefer andri design
Zaidan: because, first, I like simpler, and more structured looks, that's all
Andri: okay, go to the end of the discussion
Andri: thanks to the voters who have spent their time
Andri: thanks  for ardani and zaidan have been willing to help
Andri: thanks also for the team that has worked
Andri: Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakaatuh
